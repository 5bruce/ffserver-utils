Simple ffserver example
=======================

This is a simple ffserver example. What is needed to run it:

- ffmpeg
- lunch (https://launchpad.net/~sat-metalab/+archive/metalab)

The lunch script ensures that that the ffserver/ffmpeg pair runs and will relaunch either software in case of a crash.
The ffserver software creates a flash movie stream.
The ffmpeg creates the input for the ffserver. In current configuration it reads the first available camera and default
audio input. 

Edit lunchrc to suit your needs.

Usage:
./launchit.sh
